          <p><strong>Re: Application for Webdesigner at Ridah’s Soulutions GmbH</strong></p>
    
          <p>Dear Mr Rida Hemmo,</p>
    
          <p>I’m excited to apply for the Webdesigner role at Ridahs Soulutions GmbH. With a background in both creative and technical problem-solving—from full-stack web development to data visualization—I’m eager to bring my skills and entrepreneurial spirit to your growing team.</p>
    
          <p>In my most recent projects, I’ve independently designed and launched websites for nonprofits and small businesses, including the Sarah Zuber Scholarship Foundation and CleanWorksNW. I worked closely with clients to translate their ideas into intuitive, visually appealing, and fully functional sites. My stack includes HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, with experience integrating tools like Stripe, SendGrid, and Facebook APIs. I value clean design, responsive layouts, and seamless user experiences.</p>
    
          <p>Before transitioning to web development, I worked as an IT Business Analyst, where I created a company-wide intranet and designed a Jira-based ticketing system for streamlining external IT requests. This blend of technical precision and user-centric thinking continues to shape how I approach every project.</p>
    
          <p>What excites me most about Ridahs Soulutions is your commitment to innovation and collaboration. I thrive in dynamic, fast-paced environments and am eager to contribute not just as a developer, but as a creative partner who helps shape meaningful digital experiences. I’m also comfortable working independently and value the flexibility and entrepreneurial mindset your team promotes.</p>
    
          <p>Please find my CV and portfolio attached. I’d be thrilled to share more about my work and hear how I can contribute to your mission.</p>
    
          <p>Warm regards,<br>
          Aaliyah Hänni</p>
